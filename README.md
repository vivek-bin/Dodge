# Dodge

This is a basic survival game, where the player has to dodge blocks faling from above and reach as high as possible.

The player starts trapped in a cage, with blocks of various sizes falling from above. The player must avoid being crushed by the falling blocks, and use them as stepping stones to try to climb out of the cage.
